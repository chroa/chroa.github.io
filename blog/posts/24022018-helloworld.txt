Hi there, friend! This is where I'll be posting some of my coding adventures.

My gigantic willing to learn sometimes leads me to distract between various subjects. A blog page is something that I found useful as it can help me focus on a specific subject at a time and learn more about it in detail.

Plus I enjoy writing!

Over n'out.
